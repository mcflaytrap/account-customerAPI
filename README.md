          The assessment consists of an API to be used for opening a new "current account" of already existing 
          customers.

           Requirements

          The API will expose an endpoint which accepts the user information (customerID, initialCredit).

           Once the endpoint is called, a new account will be opened connected to the user whose ID is  
           customerID.

           Also, if initialCredit is not 0, a transaction will be sent to the new account.

          Another Endpoint will output the user information showing Name, Surname, balance, and transactions 
          of the accounts.

.           Accounts and Transactions are different services.
         
           Constraints
          Feel free to use any open source tool or framework.
          For storing the information, the data can be saved in memory and not actually persisted to an external           
          database, so that we can test the solution easier. However, remember this is a backend assignment and      
          consider layers, abstractions, testability and enterprise-level architecture carefully.
          The programming language by default is Java.
